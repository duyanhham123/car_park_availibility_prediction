# car_park_availibility_prediction

Road users who are really busy and finding parking lots can take quite some time depending on the time of the day. Thus, our project aims to aid drivers in saving time by locating the nearest parking zones with the highest vacancies based on a supervised learning model which predicts the number of available lots in the next few hours.
